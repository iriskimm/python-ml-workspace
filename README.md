This repository contains my work for learning **Machine Learning** using **ScikitLearn**. Algorithms I learned and practiced include: 
1. Linear Regression

I have built a [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/iriskimm/movie-recommendation) to apply and practice my newly built Machine Learning knowledge. This ML model recommends a list of movies to the user based on Demographic Filtering, Content Based Filtering, and Collaborative Filtering.
